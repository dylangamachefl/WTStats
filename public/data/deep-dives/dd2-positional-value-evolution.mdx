  <h2>TL;DR / Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The QB Quandary:</strong> While the <em>first</em> QB off the board has seen some wild swings in draft position, the overall <em>number</em> of QBs taken in the first five rounds remains relatively low, though 2024 saw a notable uptick.</li>
    <li><strong>RB Reign (Mostly):</strong> Running Backs consistently dominate the early rounds, often comprising over 40% of picks in the first five rounds. However, 2024 showed a significant dip in early RB selections.</li>
    <li><strong>WR Ascendancy is Real:</strong> Wide Receivers have seen a clear upward trend in early-round investment, culminating in 2024 where they became the most drafted position in the first five rounds.</li>
    <li><strong>TEs - A Sprinkling of Scarcity:</strong> Tight Ends remain a small fraction of early-round picks, with a slight increase in recent years, particularly when an elite talent is perceived.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Introduction: Why Are We Looking At This?</h2>
  <p>The annual fantasy draft is the bedrock of our league. Fortunes are made, rivalries are forged, and often, the seeds of championship rosters are sown in those crucial early rounds. But do our collective drafting habits stay the same year after year? Or do we, as a league, adapt, evolve, and perhaps even chase (or set!) new strategic trends?</p>
  <p>This deep dive peers into our league's drafting history, specifically focusing on the first five rounds. We're looking at how the perceived value of Quarterbacks (QB), Running Backs (RB), Wide Receivers (WR), and Tight Ends (TE) has shifted over time. Are we getting smarter, more aggressive, or just different? Let's find out!</p>

  <h2>The Approach: How We Crunched the Numbers</h2>
  <p>We dug into our league's historical draft data (<code>WTDraft</code> table) from 2009 to 2024. Our analysis focused on two main areas:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>The "First Off The Board":</strong> When (by overall pick number) was the very first player at each core position (QB, RB, WR, TE) selected each season?</li>
    <li><strong>Early Round Composition:</strong> What was the numerical count and percentage breakdown of QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs selected within the first five rounds of each draft?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This gives us a picture of both the urgency to grab top-tier talent at each position and the overall strategic allocation of precious early-round draft capital.</p>

  <h2>Finding #1: The "First Off The Board" - Chasing Elite Talent</h2>
  <p>When the top talent at a position starts flying off the draft board, it often signals a shift in perceived value or scarcity. Let's see how this has played out for QBs, RBs, WRs, and TEs.</p>

  <h3 style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Key Observations from Chart 1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Running Backs - The Consistent Kings:</strong> Unsurprisingly, the first Running Back has almost invariably been a top-3 pick, frequently going #1 overall. This underscores the long-held belief in the importance of an elite RB anchor. 2023 was a slight anomaly with the first RB at pick #3.</li>
    <li><strong>Quarterbacks - A Rollercoaster Ride:</strong> The draft spot for the QB1 has been the most volatile. We've seen years like 2011 and 2012 where the first QB went as early as pick #2 or #3, and others like 2016, 2018, 2022, and 2024 where they lasted well into the 30s. This suggests our league's approach to QB1 varies wildly year-to-year.</li>
    <li><strong>Wide Receivers - Early and Earlier:</strong> The first WR off the board has trended towards being an earlier pick over time. While often a top-10 pick, 2023 and 2024 saw the WR1 go #1 and #2 overall respectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Tight Ends - Scarcity Drives Spikes:</strong> The TE1 draft position also shows considerable variance. Years with a clear "generational" talent (e.g., TE1 at pick #5 in 2023) see them go very early.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Finding #2: Shaping the Core - Positional Breakdown in Rounds 1-5</h2>
  <p>The first five rounds are where teams typically build the core of their roster. How has our league allocated these crucial picks across the positions?</p>

  <h3 style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Key Observations from Charts 2 & 3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Running Backs - The Longstanding Majority:</strong> For most of the league's history, RBs have been the most heavily drafted position in the first five rounds, often accounting for 40-45% of these early picks. However, 2024 saw a dramatic shift, with RBs accounting for only ~32% of early picks.</li>
    <li><strong>Wide Receivers - The Steady Climb to the Top:</strong> The investment in WRs in the first five rounds has shown a clear upward trajectory, culminating in 2024 where they constituted a commanding 48% of early-round selections.</li>
    <li><strong>Quarterbacks - A Modest but Growing Presence:</strong> While the QB1 might go early, the overall number of QBs taken in the first five rounds remained relatively low (2-7 QBs, or 4-14%) for many years. 2023 and 2024, however, saw a notable increase.</li>
    <li><strong>Tight Ends - Consistent Scarcity:</strong> Tight ends consistently represent the smallest portion of picks in the first five rounds, typically 2-5 TEs (4-10%).</li>

  <h2>Conclusion & What This Means For You (And Your Next Draft!)</h2>
  <p>Our league's drafting tendencies are clearly not set in stone. We adapt, we react, and we evolve.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The WR Revolution is Here:</strong> If you're waiting on WRs, you might be missing the boat. The league is prioritizing them earlier and more heavily than ever before.</li>
    <li><strong>QB Value is Subjective (and Volatile):</strong> While more QBs are creeping into the first five rounds recently, the timing of the <em>first</em> QB is still a wild card.</li>
    <li><strong>RB Scarcity Still Matters, But...:</strong> The 2024 data showing a dip in early RB investment is intriguing. Is this a one-off, or the start of a new trend?</li>
    <li><strong>Adapt or Be Left Behind:</strong> Being aware of these historical patterns can inform your strategy, but always be ready to adapt to the specific dynamics of the draft room!</li>
  </ul>
