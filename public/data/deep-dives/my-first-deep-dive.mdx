# Welcome to My First Deep Dive!

This is a sample article written in **MDX**. You can use Markdown syntax like this:

*   Lists
*   Of
*   Items

And you can also embed React components directly. For example, here's an image:

<Image src="/images/wtstats-logo.png" alt="WTStats Logo" width={200} height={200} />

This demonstrates that the `Image` component from `next/image` is working correctly within your MDX files.

## Data and Charts (Optional)

If you had a data file at `public/data/deep-dives/my-first-deep-dive/chart-data.json`, you could load it and pass it to a custom chart component:

```jsx
// Example of how you might use a custom chart component (if created)
// import LineChart from '@/components/charts/LineChart';
// <LineChart data={yourChartData} />
```

This is just a placeholder to show how it would integrate.

Stay tuned for more insightful deep dives!
