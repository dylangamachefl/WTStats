import Image from 'next/image'; // If you still want to define props like width/height in MDX
                               // even if mdx-components.tsx handles the `img` tag.
                               // Or if you map <Image> specifically in your components prop.

## An Important Section

This section has some key points. We can use Tailwind classes for emphasis.

<div className="my-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-md">
  <p className="text-blue-700 font-semibold">Note:</p>
  <p className="text-blue-600">This is an important note styled with Tailwind directly in MDX.</p>
</div>

### Subsection with an Image

  width={800}
  height={550}
